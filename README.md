Repository for the challenge #4 Pandas Challenge

In this assignment, we have to create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

The background is the following:
As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I am tasked with assisting the school board and mayor in making informed decisions about future school budgets and priorities.

My initial assignment involves analyzing district-wide standardized test results. I have been granted access to all students' math and reading scores, along with detailed information about the schools they attend. It's my responsibility to aggregate this data and highlight clear trends in school performance.

To complete this challenge we have an starter code folder with a Jupyter Notebook File (PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb) to review the desired format for this assignment, in which the step by step are broken down to make a complete analysis and generate different Data Frames with the necessary information. We also have two .csv files (schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv) which will be merged to have an extensive database to complete the activity.


To complete this activity, I have used resources such as Office Hours and the assistance of ChatGPT to debug and optimize the code's functionality. Additionally, I utilized these tools to refine the format of the written report, paying special attention to the structure of the headings and the correct insertion of data tables that underpin the analysis and conclusions.
